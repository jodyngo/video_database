Database from Mai Xu, Lai Jiang, Xin Deng in Beihang University(2015). 

This database contains the fixation data of 33 standard video sequences of HEVC.

In 'video_database.mat', you can find

	videos_info: the information of 33 videos 

	video_names_list: the index for 33 videos

	subj_info: the information of 32 participants 

	subj_names_list: the index for 32 participants

	fixdata: contains fixation data of all videos from all participants.

	fixdata_fields: 
    '1: SubjectIndex (see subj_names_list)'
    '2: VideoIndex (see video_names_list)'
    '3: Timestamp (milliseconds after image display)'
    '4: GazeDuration'
    '5-6: fixation position (take upper-lift corner as origin )'
   
e.g. If a row in fixdata is '6 29 4084 183 467 319', that means this fixation is in 'ChinaSpeed.avi' recorded from JL. The start time and the duration of this fixation is 4084ms and 183ms, respectively, with the location (467,391).

As a test, you can run 'demo.m' to view the heat-map series of the target video.
